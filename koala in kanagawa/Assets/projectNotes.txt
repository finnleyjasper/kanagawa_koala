STYLE RULES ====================================================================
- If an item in the hierarchy uses camelCase a script accesses its name directly
    - OR if it is a one-word-name and in lowercase, it is accessed directly via name -- ie. "koala" or "head"

- All "active speakers" need a child gameObject called "Head"

DONT DESTROY ON LOAD // SINGLETON ==============================================
- DialogueManager
